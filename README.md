# Kickstarter_Challenge

# Overview of Project
#### Loiuse play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Louise's needed a analysis to show how different compaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goal

# Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis: I did some analysis by following the steps from the instruction in the module. I debugged by googling and watching videos from the module. I was able use google to find out how to calculate the percentage of outcomes based on goal. Please find image below.

### Challenges: One major challenge i encountered was i was getting zero(0) for all subcategory plays that were failed. I thought i was doing something wrong but i figured it out by filtering through the kick starter dataset and realised that there were not failed compaigns in the play subcategory. Please find image below

# Results
#### 1. The two major assumptions drawed from this analysis are: 
- Theater Campaigns in parent category that are done during the month of may and june are usuallly successfully
- The number of failed compaigns are almost half of the successful compaigns. 
#### 2. Based on the analysis shown, there are no cancelled plays compaigned. The success rate seems to be high when the goal is less than 1000 and betweeen the range of 1000 to 4999
#### 3. Some of the limitation of the dataset is that its too information and there are some fields that were not relevant for the analysis
#### 4. We could create analysis based on Staff pick
